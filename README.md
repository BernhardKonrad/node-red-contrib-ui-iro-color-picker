node-red-contrib-ui-iro-color-picker
====================================

Alternative color picker node utilizing the [iro.js](https://iro.js.org) widget. The main credit goes to [James](https://jamesdaniel.dev/), thank you for this nice widget.

The node-red node is highly customizable inside the editor by choosing and combining several components either as a widget or a popup window.

This is my first dashboard node so any input is highly appreciated.

**My main goal of getting a colour picker on mobile devices usable with my thumb is not achieved jet. I could not solve the modal popup to be exclusively on top of everything else. If someone more experienced than I in safari or angular could perhaps help me:**

# help needed
- fix modal popup on safari (some other ui elements still are shown above the picker widget) Any iOS / Safari / webkit expert?

- RGB object: {r: 255, g: 0, b: 0}
- RGBA object: {r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 1}
- HSL string: "hsl(360, 50%, 100%)"
- HSLA string: "hsla(360, 50%, 100%, 1)"
- HSL object: {h: 360, s: 50, l: 100}
- HSLA object: {h: 360, s: 50, l: 100, a: 1}
- HSV object: {h: 360, s: 100, v: 50}
- HSVA object: {h: 360, s: 100, v: 50, a: 1}

in addition the following input formats are supported to set individual parameters

- `msg.alpha` 0 - 1
- `msg.kelvin` 2.000 - 40.0000

if a numeric `msg.payload` is received it is assumed that the value corresponds to the output format. **In this case the output format has be set to a single value format too!**

Send `msg.enable` **false** to disable the widget.

## Outputs
Node will send the color value as `msg.payload`. The format can be defined in the configuration dialog

## General configuration

- **Label**:
    - a text string to show on the left
    - an indent for the widget to align the widget nicely 
- **Type**:
    The node can showup as a widget or a popup window
    - as widget the picker will be placed in the remaining space left by the label. Depending of the selected components the widget will take the necessary height or scaled to fit.
    - *popup center click* centered to the current mouse position
    - *popup center group* centered to the group
    - *popup center window* centered in the browser window
    - if as popup the widget can be scaled relative to the group width
    - the background color and alpha can be specified
    - the background can follow the picked color
- **bypass messages** select this to pass all incoming messages to the output
- **send**
    - **when released** send a message when the user release the mouse button
    - **on user interaction** send on every user interaction
        - the output can be limited either by a maximum frequency or dynamically
        - if *when confirmed* is checked new messages are blocked until the last message is confirmed by the backend. This should adopt the updates according to the backend speed and the network
        - if unchecked a maximum update frequency in messages per second can be defined.
- **payload** choose the desired output format.
- **topic** topic to be added to the message
- **name** name of the node inside the editor
