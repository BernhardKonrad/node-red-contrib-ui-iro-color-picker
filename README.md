node-red-contrib-ui-iro-color-picker
====================================

Alternative color picker node utilizing the [iro.js](https://iro.js.org) widget. The main credit goes to [James](https://jamesdaniel.dev/), thank you for this nice widget.

The node-red node is highly customizable inside the editor by choosing and combining several components either as a widget or a popup window.

This is my first dashboard node so any input is highly appreciated.

**My main goal of getting a colour picker on mobile devices usable with my thumb is not achieved jet. I could not solve the modal popup to be exclusively on top of everything else. If someone more experienced than I in safari or angular could perhaps help me:**

# help needed
- fix modal popup on safari (some other ui elements still are shown above the picker widget) Any iOS / Safari / webkit expert?
